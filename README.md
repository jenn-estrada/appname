### Jennifer Estrada JS Coding Challenge

I used Angular JS for this site because it is small and I didn't want to add the overhead of the Angular CLI.  Thanks for your time, and enjoy!

### To test:
0. Download this code locally

1. Change directories to '~/appname'.

2. If you are using mac OS, run 'npm config set prefix /usr/local'

3. Run 'npm install' using a command line terminal.

4. Run 'gulp serve' using a command line terminal.

5. Using Chrome or Firefox, browse to http://http://localhost:3000/

6. I am using the City of Chicago Open Data Restaurant API.  This API searches a database of restaurant inspection results.  To search, enter the name of a restaurant in the 'Search' box.  

7. I recommend 'DMK Burger Bar' or 'Burger King' as test cases to observe the pagination. 

8. View the minified JS and CSS at ~/app/dist
